              Welcome to the official website of the Bangladesh Kindergarten
              Association. Students are our future wealth and mighty. To give
              them proper education is our responsibility. If the students are
              well taught, they will be our property. They will bring us
              reputation and dignity. Otherwise, they will be the burden of
              society, As such; they will commit theft and deceit. As a result,
              there will be no peace and safety; we shall have to live with
              tension and anxiety. People will suffer a great deal of
              difficulty. So to guide the studentâ€™s to the right path is
              necessary. Talents lie concealed in the students with purity;
              Teachers must exhibit them with sincerity. Also teachers must
              teach as per quality. To lead the country to prosperity. A teacher
              is man making maker, if he does his duty, otherwise, he is man
              killing maker and he is nasty. If a teacher serves to the best of
              his ability, He will be able to gain popularity. If a student
              studies to the best of his Capacity, He will be able to acquire
              originality. So, we request the teachers to serve with honesty,
              and advise the students to study with sincerity. Teacher and
              student will maintain regularity. Also, they will maintain
              punctuality. A teacher must have morality and personality; also he
              will have solidity and individuality. In teach and students will
              lie affability and validity, Also will lie affinity and
              advisability. A teacher should be chatty, In order to gain
              familiarity. To be good teacher, one should have diligence and
              probity. Also should have dainty and specialty, under the
              circumstances, I believe with certainly, Teachers and students
              will do the needful with guaranty.
